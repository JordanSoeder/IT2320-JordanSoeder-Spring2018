<question id="question1">Describe the purpose of AJAX. What advantage does AJAX provide over a traditional HTML form submit
<answer>
    The purpose of AJAX to enable asynchronous function calls within an browser to the back end web server without reloading the entire page.
    In traditional HTML, at every form submit (also called postback), the entire page gets submitted thereby giving a feeling of
    entire page flickering (or refreshing). In AJAX only the HTML section that is configured for asynchronous call gets a flickering feeling because thats the
    only section that gets submitted back to web server.

      JSON and XML are simple structured text data that can be passed as a simple string to
      any program easily. It is independent of database. For Ajax implementation like jQuery, it becomes easier
      once the data is available in such simple formats. It does not has the overload of connecting
      to secure databases in the backend. It frees the back end and lets the front end work smoothly with the limited desired data.
